The Komodo Cafe is getting a new menu. 

The cafe manager at Komodo wants to be able to create a menu item, delete a menu item,
and list all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app. 

Each of their menu items will contain the following:
a meal number so employees can say "I'll have the #5", 
a meal name, 
a description, 
a list of ingredients in the meal, 
and a price. 

Your task is to do the following:
1. Create a Menu class with properties, constructors, and fields.
2. Create a MenuRepository class that has methods needed.
3. Create a Test Class for your repository methods. (You don't need to test
your constructors or objects. Just the methods.)
4. Create a Program file that allows the restaurant manager to add, delete, 
and see all items in the menu list.

Notes:
We don't need to update the items right now.
