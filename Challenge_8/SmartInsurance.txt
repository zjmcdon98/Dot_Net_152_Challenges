Smart Insurance

Komodo wants to work with smart cars and to calculate insurance. The car tracks all
the data for a driver: how often they speed or follow the speed limit,
how often they swerve outside of their lane, how often they roll through a stop sign, and 
how often they follow too closely. 

Write a program that shows premium costs based on a driver's driving habits.

Note: This is very open ended and allows you to be creative. A base premium cost can be
an estimated number.
