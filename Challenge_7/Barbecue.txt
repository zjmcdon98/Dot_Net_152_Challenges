Scenario: Komodo Insurance is trying to improve their efficiency in 
spending for company barbecues. They have two booths, an ice cream booth
and a burger booth. Each employee is given one ticket for each of the booths.
Each employee can get one burger or one dog with the burger booth ticket. 
Each employee can get one ice cream cone with their ice cream ticket.

The app will track data about the barbecue after it is over. 

Here's what they want to do:
They will want to show a total cost for the party. 
They also want to track total tickets taken at each booth, 
and total tickets taken at the party.

For the burger booths, they want to calculate the cost of 
each major type of food: veggie burgers, hamburgers, and hot dogs. 
(This cost will include the cost of the bun). The cost of ketchup, 
mustard, plasticware, and napkins can all be dumped in one miscellaneous 
lump sum property together. 

For treat booths, they want to calculate the cost of each bag of 
popcorn and each gallon of ice cream. They will also need to collect 
the total number of tickets taken for this booth. The cost of spoons, 
bowls, and miscellaneous items can be thrown into one lump sum.

One key result in the program will be for party planners to see a list of all parties 
with total cost and total tickets taken for an event.
